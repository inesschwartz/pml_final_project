        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying music tracks into different genres using the GTZAN dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genre classification is a fundamental problem in the field of music information retrieval and has significant applications in music recommendation systems, music library organization, and streaming services. Accurate genre classification can enhance user experience by enabling personalized music recommendations and efficient music discovery. Lastly, being able to categorize individual characteristics of a dataset (ei. music tracks) into a greater theme (genre, in this case) is a very relevant and useful application of machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### About the dataset ###\n",
        "The GTZAN dataset is a publicly available dataset consisting of 1000 audio tracks categorized into 10 genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. Each genre contains 100 tracks, each with a duration of 30 seconds. This dataset was chosen because it provides a standard benchmark for music genre classification and because it presents a variety of challenges around audio and machine learning which we did not get a chance to work with too much during the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methods ###\n",
        "\n",
        "The methodology of this project begins with pre-processing the data, which includes converting audio files into a consistent format and sample rate, and extracting audio features.\n",
        "For model selection, we tried a few different approaches and ultimately used a Decision Tree Classification to classify genres csv files made by the tracks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets. We will perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation on the training set to optimize model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate the results, we will employ several performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. Accuracy will measure the proportion of correctly classified instances, while precision and recall will help understand the model's performance in predicting each genre accurately. The F1-score will ideally balance both metrics. The confusion matrix will visualize the classification results and identify misclassifications. Cross-validation will ensure the robustness of the model and its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, this project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of machine learning approaches for genre classification and demonstrate the practicality of such applications.\n",

        "## Hyper Parameter tuning ##\n",
        "\n",
        "For the Random Forest Classification model, hyperparameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split were optimized using cross-validation. The model had a high accuracy percentage of 79%.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also tried to improve our test results by adding bagging classifiers or ada boost classifiers but, these other forms of hyperparameter tuning were redudant and caused overfitting (in the case of the bagging classifier).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Random Forest**, being an ensemble method itself, combined multiple decision trees to provide robust performance and reduce overfitting, making it a strong baseline. Using Random Forest as the base estimator for Bagging and AdaBoost  did not add significant value since these methods are generally more effective with simpler, weaker learners.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the increased complexity and computational overhead of these methods did not translate to better performance due to diminishing returns. With these results we concluded that the current dataset and features have allowed the Random Forest model to reach near-optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusions ###\n",
        "The high accuracy of your Random Forest model can be attributed to several key factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firstly, the quality of the data played a crucial role; well-cleaned data ensured that the model was trained on accurate and relevant information, reducing noise and potential errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effective feature selection, such as extracting Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, spectral contrast, and zero crossing rate, ensured the model captured the most important aspects of the audio data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the Random Forest algorithm itself is a powerful ensemble method that combined multiple decision trees to provide robust performance and reduce overfitting. This inherent strength is further enhanced by the randomness introduced in selecting subsets of data and features, allowing the model to capture a broad range of patterns. The use of systematic hyperparameter tuning ensures that the model is optimized for the specific dataset, further contributing to its high accuracy. Lastly, the balanced nature of the dataset across genres likely aided in the model's ability to accurately classify each genre. These combined factors, including data quality, feature relevance, and the robust nature of the Random Forest algorithm, contributed to the model's impressive accuracy independed of other hyperparameter tuning."

        "The performance of the Random Forest model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while precision and recall were evaluated for each genre to assess the model's ability to predict each class accurately. The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, was also calculated. The confusion matrix provided a visualization of classification results and helped identify misclassifications. The results summary showed an overall accuracy of 85%. Precision, recall, and F1-score were detailed per genre, with higher performance observed in genres like classical and jazz, and lower performance in genres like reggae and rock. The confusion matrix revealed clear distinctions for most genres, though some overlap was noted in similar-sounding genres."

We think that given  its robustness to overfitting and ability to handle a large number of features, the Random Forest Model was a good selection for classifying our music genre's accurately.\n"
